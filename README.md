The goal of this project is to develop **algorithms and predictive models for variables associated with breast cancer**. Additionally, the project aims to create an innovative platform that empowers healthcare professionals to make informed therapeutic decisions from the moment of diagnosis. This approach eliminates the need to wait for follow-ups to evaluate patient progress, enabling more timely and effective interventions.
