***   

The goal of this project is to develop **algorithms and predictive models for variables associated with breast cancer**. Additionally, the project aims to create an innovative platform that empowers healthcare professionals to make informed therapeutic decisions from the moment of diagnosis. This approach eliminates the need to wait for follow-ups to evaluate patient progress, enabling more timely and effective interventions.

## :hammer: Usage

The steps to follow to use the application locally will be described.

### :paw_prints: Steps

## 🔣Execution instructions

### 👟Steps 
1. Download this repository
2. Check Requirements 
3. Configure DataBase
4. Configure IDE
5. Run Application in the IDE
6. Go to https://localhost/8443/

### 📋Requirements
- Java: JDK 21 --> https://www.oracle.com/es/java/technologies/downloads/#java21
- MySQL: v.8.0.41.0 (Explained in DataBase Configuration)
- Maven: 3.9.9
- Spring Boot 3.4.1
- IDE (explained in IDE Configuration)

### 💾DataBase Config
- Download MySQL v.8.0.41.0
