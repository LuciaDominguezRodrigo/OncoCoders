***   

The goal of this project is to develop **algorithms and predictive models for variables associated with breast cancer**. Additionally, the project aims to create an innovative platform that empowers healthcare professionals to make informed therapeutic decisions from the moment of diagnosis. This approach eliminates the need to wait for follow-ups to evaluate patient progress, enabling more timely and effective interventions.

### üïπÔ∏èIDE Config
- We have used IntelliJ IDEA, bt it can be possible to use other IDE¬¥S (like Visual Studio Code)
- Install Maven and Spring for your IDE
*************
### üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup
To set up the development environment for the SPA application using Angular, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. **Angular CLI**: Install Angular CLI globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
#### Start Angular
1. **Clone the project**
   ```bashhttps://github.com/LuciaDominguezRodrigo/OncoCoders.git ```
2. **Make sure the backend is running**: Following the instructions `üî£Execution instructions` of the documentation
3. **Redirect to the ProjectFrontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd OncoCoders/ProjectFrontend
   ```
4. **Install all the necessary modules**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the SPA**

## üß≠ Possible actions to perform in the application
### Login
 To log in, access the screen that displays the corresponding form. Enter the username and password, and you will be redirected to the personalized home page (since the session has been added). For this action, having an account is required. 

 ### Register
Through the login screen (via the "Sign Up" link) or the registration button on the default home screen, access will be provided to a user creation form. Those users whose email contains the word "hospital" will be created with the role of doctor. Those whose email contains the word "researcher" will be created with the researcher role, and the rest, by default, with the user role. 
Page administrators will be created by default

### Update profile info
On the profile page, fields can be edited using the "Edit" button next to each one. When clicked, a form will appear, allowing the user to update their information. It is important to note that if the zone is changed, the reference hospital will automatically update to match the assigned doctor's hospital.

### Patient diagnosis
The patient user will be able to access their most recent complete diagnosis through their profile, as well as via the corresponding button in the sidebar. The doctor will be able to access the most recent diagnoses of their assigned patient by entering the patient's ID in a form, which can be accessed by clicking the "Go to Diagnosis Results" button. The doctor will also be able to view patient diagnoses through the "Consult Statistics" button on their profile.

### View patient list
The doctor will be able to view the list of their assigned patients by navigating through the "Patients" button in the sidebar.

### View general correlation data statistics
The doctor will be able to view various data correlation charts by navigating through the "Dashboard" button in the sidebar.

### Access to patient first and relapse form
The doctor will be able to access the initial diagnosis form for a first-time diagnosed patient through their profile, as well as the relapse form.
